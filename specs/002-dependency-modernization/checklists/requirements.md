# Specification Quality Checklist: Dependency Modernization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No unnecessary implementation details; named versions and coordinates are acceptance constraints from the feature brief
- [x] Focused on maintainer and end-user value
- [x] Written for technical and non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria describe observable outcomes
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] Technical constraints are limited to explicitly required compatibility and automation outcomes

## Notes

- Validation passed in one iteration. The exact version and coordinate constraints are retained because they are explicit acceptance requirements, not speculative implementation choices.
